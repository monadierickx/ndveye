### Corn counting

### Reef mapping

We can use NDVeye to improve OpenStreetMap. [It is a open spatial database](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about), *"built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, caf√©s, railway stations, and much more, all over the world"*.

There are some yet unmapped reefs in the Tuamotus islands.

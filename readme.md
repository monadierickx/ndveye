# NDVeye Plugin

## Algorithm details

## Example workflows

### Corn counting

### Reef mapping

We can use NDVeye to improve OpenStreetMap, [an open spatial database](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about), *"built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, caf√©s, railway stations, and much more, all over the world"*.

There are some yet unmapped reefs within lagoons of the Tuamotus islands:

We can polygonize these reefs using NDVeye. Let's use Sentinel-2 imagery as raster input. [EO Browser](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser) can help us acquire suitable imagery. There, we can search for *Toau atoll*, edit cloud coverage settings, copy the s3 path of the image & visualize it straight away:

You can inspect the different bands in EO, and list the files using AWS s3 CLI:

```
aws s3 ls --request-payer requester sentinel-s2-l2a/tiles/6/L/XH/2024/3/26/0/ --recursive
```

I choose to work with the B04 band. Download imagery:

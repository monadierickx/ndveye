# NDVeye Plugin


## Algorithm details

## Example workflows

### Corn counting

### Reef mapping

We can use NDVeye to improve OpenStreetMap, [an open spatial database](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about), *"built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, caf√©s, railway stations, and much more, all over the world"*.

There are some yet unmapped reefs within lagoons of the Tuamotus islands:

We can polygonize these reefs using NDVeye. Let's use Sentinel-2 imagery as raster input. [EO Browser](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser) can help us acquire suitable imagery. There, we can search for *Toau atoll*, edit cloud coverage settings, copy the s3 path of the image & visualize it straight away:
